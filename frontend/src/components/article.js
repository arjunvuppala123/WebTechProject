                        Shawn makes music for stadium-show attendees to belt back at him, but the songs he writes about himself are always better than the lover-boy pablum. “Monster,” a song about voyeuristic celebrity fandom and the glee with which we watch the people we’ve built up fall down, goes a long way toward explaining why he keeps his guard up, although the sentiment rings truer from guest star Justin Bieber, the hopeful, troubled T-800 to Mendes’s slicker, more versatile T-1000. (“I was nine when ‘One Time’ came out,” Shawn told Lowe. “He was Elvis to me.”) “Piece of You” does a great job of sidestepping the cleanliness of the artist’s persona, adding a much needed dose of negativity to break up all the cheer as Mendes sings about the insecurities that come with having a beautiful girlfriend other guys lust after. “Call My Friends” laments feeling like your buddies’ lives are passing you by; the pure ache for benign niceties like zoning out on the couch stoned with friends almost makes it a tearjerker in a pandemic. If you came to Wonder to find out what’s going on behind the brown doe eyes, underneath the too-perfect Superboy veneer, you won’t get much closer to the story. But when the band sounds this good, you wonder, does it matter?
